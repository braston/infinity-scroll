#Infinity Scroll Project

This was a quick project from a Javascript Web Project course on Udemy. Fundamentals covered:

-Used loading.io to generate custom "loading" graphic. Included this in project via source link in image element
-Centering custom load image via CSS translate command (avoids centering on corner of image, removes offset)
-Using Unsplash API to fetch images, putting together API request
-Using DRY principle (do not repeat) to optimize processing of API data
-Using forEach() to traverse arrays and document.createElement / element.setAttribute commands to add to DOM
-Worked with window and associated properties, as well as DOM scroll event to detect when a user has scrolled to end of page
